The Monty Hall Problem (Simulation)
==============================

This project showcases a simulation of the ever-fascinating Monty Hall problem. Why fascinating? Eventough the problem itself as well as the mathematics behind is quite simple to get, the intuition of the solution is missleading in such a way, that even statisticians were blinded by that problem. However, the theory behind that problem can be verified in simulations...and this repo gives provides you the code to play around with!

*And here is the problem in short:*
Let's suppose you are in *Monty Hall's* show (American television game show *Let's Make a Deal* and named after its original host, *Monty Hall*) and you are facing three closed doors (they look exactly the same). 

Everbody in the room (and those watching the show) know, that there is **1 prize (car)** and **2 goats** behind the doors.

Now Monty wants you to pick a door of your choice (Let's say you pick door #1). This door (#1) remains closed so far. Now Monty - who knows where the car and the goats are - opens 1 of the remaining 2 doors where a goat is behind (Let's say he opens door #3). It looks like this...

Now Monty asks you...

**a.) If you want to stay with your initial choice (In this case door #1)**

**OR**

**b.) If you want to switch to the other door that is also still closed (door #2)**


What would you do? What would be your strategy and why?

I skip the part with the mathematical explainations here (maths on that problem turns out to be quite simple). This can be found in tons of resources on the web:
